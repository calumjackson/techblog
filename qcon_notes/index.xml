      <description>Randy took the time to talk through High Performance Culture, and how to build and scale it. This was my favourite talk of the conference.
Randy went through a lot of material verrry quickly, but all of it was super interesting.
Initially he basically talked through the accelerate [accelerate] book at a super high level, and the key notes he took which lead into his points in the rest of the talk.</description>

      <description>Hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen this presentation, but had heard it was good from colleagues. Having watched a few times, he is a very confident talker who keeps you engaged at all times.
The main thing I took away from the talk was how clear and concise his observations, comments, and articulations were. It was a well put together piece, which has probably been practiced across the land!
Whether this was due to the Wardley Maps or his own charisma, I can&amp;rsquo;t comment, but imagine it would be both.</description>
