<p>Notes on reading Camille Fournier&rsquo;s <em>The Manager&rsquo;s Path</em>.</p>

<h3 id="mentoring">Mentoring</h3>

<p>Chapter 2, covering mentoring, was a insightful piece into how and why we should place value into mentoring engineers in our working life, whether it is the intern, new hire, or just an engineer in our team trying to learn new skills.</p>

<p>In the case of the intern, give them a structure involvement in a project which they will be able to contribute to, but give them more than enough time to do this (i.e. double the time you would expect a new hire to take). Make sure you can make time to regularly catch up with the intern to provide feedback, and get to know their ways of working. The main value of this is to give the intern an interesting experience in the aim that they will strongly consider applying to work for the company once they complete their degree. As with all the people you mentor, this gives you a perspective on how people will learn and integrate into the teams, and help you learn how to help people grow.</p>

<p>For new hires, it was a similar case; Spend regular time working with them to ensure they are able to log into the systems, checkout code bases and have access to repositories etc. It was also important to spend time with them to help them understand the <em>unwritten rules</em> of a company, things which people <em>just know</em> but can take falling foul of a few times to find out.</p>

<p>Keeping regular and planned meetings to help mentees organise their thoughts and questions before the session, and have targets and goals to work towards each week.</p>

<p>A important point was that you should not be taking on a mentoring role if you are not going to have time to commit to it. It helps neither you or the mentee to have unstructured relationship like this and just delays progress on both parts, as the time you do end up spending has less tangible benefit.</p>

<h3 id="tech-leads">Tech Leads</h3>

<h5 id="what-is-it">What is it</h5>

<p>Being a tech lead doesn&rsquo;t need you to be the best engineer in your team, but it does need you to be able to influence, delegate, listen, and manage where a great engineer may want to focus on the technical details of the project.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not critical that you understand the lowest level of the code, but that you can understand the concepts when they are being discussed and that you understand their place in the wider framework of the software architecture. This is something I have regularly found when stepping in to help on projects where my understanding of the core technology was not brilliant, but working with the team to understand the core patterns of the technology and it&rsquo;s setup we could understand it&rsquo;s place in the platform and how we would integrate it correctly.</p>

<p><img src="https://calumjackson.github.io/techblog/images/reading_images/manager_pic.jpg" alt="tech lead pic" /></p>

<h5 id="planning">Planning</h5>

<p>Planning a project is important part of being a tech lead. Managing the pieces of a project and designing how they will come together in your delivery plan is important to understanding the whole piece of how and when the project will come together. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be perfect as we know things will go wrong, but even agile setups need a project plan which can be adjusted and manipulated regularly to keep the delivery on track. Agile methodologies generally just break this down into small enough pieces that they would be parts in the stories and sprint planning.</p>

<h4 id="being-a-good-tech-lead">Being a good tech lead</h4>

<p>This section mainly revolves around taking your expectations to be a burning light in the technology world and being able to lead the charge of developing exciting software with a strong team around you, and understand that most of being a strong tech leads is taking the time to understand your team, working with them to make sure the whole team gets to work on the parts they are interested in but also have coverage of both the boring and exciting work so that the team have a good holistic understanding of the code they are working.</p>

<p>Being a great communicator also comes heavily into this, through talking or documenting, as you will now be the voice of your team in a lot of situations. This means you will have to be able to communicate the technology and issues you are facing to a wide range of people, which may include talking up or down the company hierarchy and being able to frame the work being done in ways that seem simplistic from a technology point of view. This is important in getting buy-in from the people who will fund or support the projects you want to implements, and also becomes an important way of understanding if the work you want to do will have tangible value to your &ldquo;customers&rdquo;.</p>
