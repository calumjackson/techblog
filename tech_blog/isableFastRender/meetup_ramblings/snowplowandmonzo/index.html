<hr />

<p><strong>My. <em>Second.</em> Meetup.</strong></p>

<p>This meet-up was organised by the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DataCouncil-AI-London-Data-Engineering-and-Science/">Data Council.ai</a> team, and had a couple of switched on presenters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Snow Plow</li>
<li>Monzo</li>
<li>pgAudit</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="snow-plow">Snow Plow</h3>

<p>The first of many Stephen&rsquo;s on stage this evening was from Snow Plow (the meetup sponsor), who are a data analytics <em>platform</em> (still not sure how well used that term is generally - is this something that is used to build other services on? Maybe I should write down <em>what being a platform means</em> to me).</p>

<p>My vague understanding of the operation of this was that Snow Plow is a data analytics platform which allows eventing to be almost instantly tracked and analysed within the data warehouses. Having side-<em>tracked</em> myself reading their <a href="https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow">github pages</a>, I can see they are based around a general event tracking and their individuality comes from being an open source, loosely coupled architecture (read: cool, well structured for microservices architecture).</p>

<p>The actual talk was from a lead engineer, who was pushing the idea that tracking testing is as important as any other testing if you are to be a data analytics company with any <strong>integrity</strong>. The validation of tracking can be built into testing automation much like any other functionality, and in turn built into your CI pipeline, such that you get a constant valid stream of data hitting your warehouse - with the obvious benefits of not missing out on precious data, and more importantly not shifting <strong>bad data</strong> 😱 into your warehouse. This all seemed pretty reasonable, and got me thinking that is this the evolution of test driven development, moreover is this an extenstion of TDD or is it a new TDD - Tracking Driven Development? If data is a main output of your service, where does that sit in importance to actual functionality 😧.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I asked a question around whether this is a extension of TDD or if it&rsquo;s own TrackingDD, but lead into the philosophical aspects I was expecting didn&rsquo;t really pay off (I was probably being rather gratuitous to myself to expect it to 😂), but is something I might keep thinking about&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="monzo">Monzo</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this company need an introduction (unless your reading this from a non-UK background - they&rsquo;re a startup tech bank). They seem to have a lot of code in <a href="https://github.com/monzo">github</a>, their <a href="https://docs.monzo.com/">open API</a> stuff looks interesting and a good use of online documentation (is this auto generated via Slate????), so I might have a dig around in there to see how a well revered tech start up does things 😆.</p>

<p>The onus of the talk here was around Monzo migrating to <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> (data build tool), and how that is really cool and useful. dbt is open source data transformation layer for analytics, which provides an abstraction in the coding which allows for essentially schemaless(?) data structures, such that the underlying queries can be restructured without affecting the output.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:1313/techblog/images/meetup_pics/product.svg?classes=shadow" alt="transformation" /></p>

<p>The view below shows how the queries are built within the code at a high level. To my mind this is essentially an extension of database views, but probably with a bit less of the hassle maintaining changes. This is a <strong>compiled language</strong> rather than interpreted, which gives the benefit of noticing any issues at deployment rather than runtime, with the tradeoff of.. I&rsquo;m not sure, actually being more tightly coupled to the datasets below? Is that how it works 🙈</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:1313/techblog/images/meetup_pics/transform.svg?classes=float-left,shadow" alt="build" /></p>

<p>After talking with a few people later, it sounds like dbt deals with issues like missing columns by just filling them as blank, which is either a good thing for preventing code failures, or bad as it doesn&rsquo;t guarantee data consistency if those columns are being used in a join. I guess a limitation of the system which the developers need to understand!</p>

<p>Finally, a useful feature was the ability to <strong>tag</strong> the table / view abstractions, such that they could tagged with personally identifiable information (pii), and a data analytic graph could be automatically built to show the tagged dependencies in a top level query to give you a view of what kind of data exists within it.</p>

<p>On the actual migration points, Monzo mentioned a few points they found useful</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Don&rsquo;t mix re-factoring with code migration - it causes hassle everywhere rather than isolating it.</p></li>

<li><p>Quick is better, allows you to get back to BAU quicker and deal with issues via BAU.</p></li>

<li><p>Time is hard to get from people. Monzo had a team of ~40 people working on it but not at full capacity. Documentation was key.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pgaudit">pgAudit</h3>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t do this talk justice as I was distracted having lost a tooth filling in the break (note to self, <em>pizza is bad for learning</em>). From what I listened to this was a tool to verbosely audit whilst creating a standardised auditing format.</p>
