## First Thoughts

This could be the most important book I read this year, given the impact it could have upon my ability to learn and retrieve information.

## Key Learning Concepts

1. Retrieval practice is important to cementing knowledge in your mind and preventing forgetfulness of a subject.
2. Interleaving learning increases retrieval practice implicitly, as you essentially have to do some form of retrieval to remember where you are in the context of reading / learning. (I.e. context switching can be good for learning, however this is probably not good for application of flow as there is significant time associated with context switching).
1. Repetition is not an effective way of learning, as it doesn't test the mind in a way which encourages remembering. I wonder if this is a reason to try and describe a concept in different ways - so whilst it is repetition, it is forcing you to think about the problem in a format which is different to the original way it was described.
1. Massed learning (cramming) has the same downfalls as repetition in that it doesn't stimulate persistent memory.
1. Learning in the form of a story builds a timeline which people can associate with memories, so commits these stories to memory. Is it possible that people can become more emotionally attached to a story or that they are more likely to reflect on a story later on, which will re-invigorate the memories.
1. Attempting to find a solution before knowing the answer improves learning, even if the answer you originally get is wrong. There is likely to be some essence of actions and learning requiring some previous knowledge, so it's probably not something to really hold yourself back on. This is also going to help problem solving skills, whether this is in the pattern of understanding how you solved a problem where you previously did not know the solution, or if it mainly just covers that usually the problems you solve will include the solution you have already worked out, I don't know.
1. If you can perceive the underlying principles of similar sets of problems, you are more likely to be able to recall how to solve a problem and be more likely to pick the correct principle to solve a problem when in unfamiliar problems.
1. Mechanical repitition has a limit, whilst _elaboration_, the act of taking the knowledge you have gained and expressing it in your own terms is boundless, such that there need be no end to your learning. So this is another good reason for this random blog in that if I can turn what I am reading into cognitive thoughts upon the subject, link it to existing knowledge I had, then the chances of me remembering are much higher. I guess the question on this will be is how much time can I afford myself to be able to effectively re-quiz the concepts in these books or test myself regularly as well as actually have a life :sweat_smile:

## The Importance of Retrieval

The recurring theme I believe will be brought to the fore throughout the book will be that retrieval is key. Early discussions in this chapter note how 53% of knowledge is retrieved in classroom environments when simple quizzes are interspersed throughout the studying period (one close to the initial learning, and then periodically inbetween). Where a set of students previously lost 13% of knowledge to recall, they stayed at a level with their initial recalling percentages after a week.

I wonder how this works in practice for reading a book - should I make notes on the book and then write myself key questions, to answer instantly and then at a later date?

## Massed Practice = Massed Waste

This chapter carried the key theme of how repetition of a tasks with the aim of mastery is a strong method of forgetting said skill, and that varied, spaced, and interleaved practice are all more appropriate for longer term mastery of a skill, despite the _perceived_ difficulties initially found in learning.

_Perceived_ improvements in massed learning were often explicitly shown to students who would learn skills more consistently if they had spaced learning vs repeated massed learning - however, students still often felt they had learnt better with massed learning, which seems to be an apparent syndrome of humans struggle to contradict their own deep based beliefs. An area of perceived benefits is _blocked_ massed practice which intimate varied practice, such as practicing 3 putts from 3 different distances in repeated cycles. Whilst this may appear to be varied, the repetition in cycles again prevents mastery of the skill in a way that a much more varied style would have, such as practicing 3 putts at short range at one hole, then 3 putts at a long range at the next, then perhaps 3 short putts again before moving to medium putts.

Real world integration of the skills is a solid way to practice and interleave "tests", whilst having the key addition of implied space between testing forced upon you by you general work tasks. For example, doctors switching between patients in A&E have to context switch regularly, which creates the state of interleaving, and also creates a natural break in the repetition of treating a single patient / cause. This can be seen as similar to a programmer solving a problem in one domain and moving to a separate domain instead of staying in the same area. In the workplace or productive environment, it is likely that this will need to be thought about in the context of flow, in that people can be effective in a consistent mindset for an extended amount of time without having to context switch. The obvious answer here is what is already _harped on about endlessly_ in this chapter, **variation**. :sweat_smile: Mixing your work between interleaved work where you are looking to do some work in a somewhat timely manner, but learning from it is almost as key to doing it, compared to work where you may already have solid foundations in the core concepts and you need to be efficient to meet a deadline.

A similar context of variation & interleaving is solving a climbing wall problem - if you split this into two pieces, the first and final third, if you learn to solve these problems you are more likely to understand how to solve the middle segment despite having not traversed it! You will have the context of the shape your body needs to be to lead into the final problem, and will understand the position you will be in leaving the first third.

Something which is mentioned regularly which I think has helped my learning is **_Reflection_**. Reading through this book reading a lot of places where I haven't been effective with my learning, reflection is one skill I (ironically) do without thinking too much about. This is where you are able to consider the concepts being taken, look at them in different angles, consider them against things you already know, question them (& particularly question them against what you already know, given the importance of associating learnings with existing foundational knowledge).

Look into the [Leitner flash card system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) - where you have four pots of flash cards with 4 levels of difficulty for you remembering. Practice the ones you find hardest most, but make sure you practice with the easier ones relatively regularly too. Practicing _foundation_ knowledge on a less regular basis is key to retaining that knowledge on a level of mastery. If you happen to get one of the easier questions wrong, move it up to the more difficult pot. If you get one right, move it to the lower pot.
