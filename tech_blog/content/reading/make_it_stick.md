## First Thoughts

This could be the most important book I read this year, given the impact it could have upon my ability to learn and retrieve information.

## Key Learning Concepts

1. Retrieval practice is important to cementing knowledge in your mind and preventing forgetfulness of a subject.
2. Interleaving learning increases retrieval practice implicitly, as you essentially have to do some form of retrieval to remember where you are in the context of reading / learning. (I.e. context switching can be good for learning, however this is probably not good for application of flow as there is significant time associated with context switching).
1. Repetition is not an effective way of learning, as it doesn't test the mind in a way which encourages remembering. I wonder if this is a reason to try and describe a concept in different ways - so whilst it is repetition, it is forcing you to think about the problem in a format which is different to the original way it was described.
1. Massed learning (cramming) has the same downfalls as repetition in that it doesn't stimulate persistent memory.
1. Learning in the form of a story builds a timeline which people can associate with memories, so commits these stories to memory. Is it possible that people can become more emotionally attached to a story or that they are more likely to reflect on a story later on, which will re-invigorate the memories.
1. Attempting to find a solution before knowing the answer improves learning, even if the answer you originally get is wrong. There is likely to be some essence of actions and learning requiring some previous knowledge, so it's probably not something to really hold yourself back on. This is also going to help problem solving skills, whether this is in the pattern of understanding how you solved a problem where you previously did not know the solution, or if it mainly just covers that usually the problems you solve will include the solution you have already worked out, I don't know.
1. If you can perceive the underlying principles of similar sets of problems, you are more likely to be able to recall how to solve a problem and be more likely to pick the correct principle to solve a problem when in unfamiliar problems.
1. Mechanical repitition has a limit, whilst _elaboration_, the act of taking the knowledge you have gained and expressing it in your own terms is boundless, such that there need be no end to your learning. So this is another good reason for this random blog in that if I can turn what I am reading into cognitive thoughts upon the subject, link it to existing knowledge I had, then the chances of me remembering are much higher. I guess the question on this will be is how much time can I afford myself to be able to effectively re-quiz the concepts in these books or test myself regularly as well as actually have a life :sweat_smile:

## The Importance of Retrieval

The recurring theme I believe will be brought to the fore throughout the book will be that retrieval is key. Early discussions in this chapter note how 53% of knowledge is retrieved in classroom environments when simple quizzes are interspersed throughout the studying period (one close to the initial learning, and then periodically inbetween). Where a set of students previously lost 13% of knowledge to recall, they stayed at a level with their initial recalling percentages after a week.

I wonder how this works in practice for reading a book - should I make notes on the book and then write myself key questions, to answer instantly and then at a later date?
