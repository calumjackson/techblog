##  What is tokenisation

Conversion of the 16 digit card number into a token, which can be used in a more secure landscape given it can be restricted in use to certain devices, certain merchants, or certain transaction types.

This reduces the level of fraud against cards (as fraud is much simpler once you have the 16 digit code), which will reduce costs throughout the 4 party model. This should trickle down to lower transaction pricing, which in time increases the accessibility into the markets, and existing merchants may be able to pass savings onto customers.

## How does tokenisation work

A payments provider registers the card and payment preferences, before requesting a token from Visa,

Visa will generate a token in the app, which will be shared with the issuer. This token is then the passed via the acquirer and the issuers.

The merchant will send the token to the acquirer, who will authorise with VISA / Issuer. This is then later cleared too. Visa authorisese the transcation with the token at the issuer side. No card details are used in the transaction at all.


# Aim for the interview

* What will the role entail? What does a typical day look like?
* Am I suitable for the role?
* Experience for Senior level
  * Brand myself as a junior SA, as I've had experience in the role, and may be able to carry a Senior role but would also be happy to build that experience up over the coming years.
  * Would like to test myself in different environments and challenges, and VISA being a such a world renowned institution provides a level to do that.
  * If this doesn't work out then it's a useful soundboard to what solution architecture looks like outside of Worldpay.
