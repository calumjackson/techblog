# Key Info

_Push Payments_: Buyer Initiated payments, where buyer provides the card details and then pays the sellers bank account.
  * Push payments are considered non-repudiable (safe to spend immediately) as the buy has authorised the transaction.
  * Reduce payments processing to single transaction management, removing intermediary steps of reconciliation between the two endpoints, and reducing issuer costs associated with payments.
  * Instant payments offer choice to the consumers - gaming is a good industry use case as it returns winnings to keep users at the table.

_Pull Payments_: Supplier Initiated

# VISA Direct

Visa Direct is a real-time push payment platform to enable expedited payments to customers or small businesses using the debit card rails provided via VisaNet. It has processed 3.4 billion transactions as of late March (2bn in the last year). Visa Direct is currently open as three options:

1. Business to Customer (B2C)
2. Business to Small Business (B2SB)
3. Peer to Peer / Person to Person (P2P)

One oft cited use case is payments to the gig-economy, where businesses like Uber will be managing the debiting of fares from customers centrally, however Uber drivers can opt to be paid for their fare immediately via push payment (at a fee from Uber) rather than a daily settled ACH payment which could take days to actually reach bank accounts where the banking route or issuer has slower settlement timelines (or don't work weekends / bank holidays).

The reach of Visa Direct is 200 countries and territories. These cross border payments allow money to move real time cross border removing the settlement delays associated with banking systems cross borders. **Remove the requirement of originators / acquirers to have to setup connections to local payment networks**

## Earthport

Visa owns one of the largest independent account clearing house (ACH) networks - so basically now VISA can use push payments through both card and bank rails. This has opened up a large network of accessibility for VISA direct payouts, which furthers the network effect of VISA Direct & therefore increses its growth and value.

# Interview

## Senior Solution Consultant

* Supporting Acquirer and Originator Enablement
  * I imagine this will entail building relationships with new and existing acquirers and help them build their product roadmap to enable Visa Debit integration.
  * This will likely also require building product overviews and understanding how customers want to take push payments forward, including understanding what their acquirer platforms help enable and how the features Visa Direct provides can help move them towards new opportunities.
  * This could be a useful place for value chain mapping to show how the landscape will change for companies as they start to embrace push payments.
  * Will need to help acquirers understand the changing nature of payments and how the model will affect their business - for example if an acquirer only settles a merchant on a daily basis, there is a increased risk associated where effectively the scheme deductions are liable.


# Visa Possible Questions

  * Why you want to work at Visa? Why do you want this role?
    * It's an institution, as Zero said to Mr Gustaf in Grand Budapest Hotel.
    * It's an ubuiquitous entity which everyone instantly associates with payments, and provides the means for people, businesses, and governments to thrive by opening up payment possibilities to them.
    * Empowers businesses by providing them the rails to take payments from customers across the globe, abstracts the complexity of cross border payments, etc.
    * Has a strong inclusion and diversity presence, I found that incredibly powerful to see pages and pages of Women and people from diverse backgrounds in positions of leadership and influence. I think a lot of the issue with getting women into tech is around the stigmas which are ingrained in schools and not having role models who represent their backgrounds.


  * What examples do you have of providing support/leading teams/managing projects?
    * Building Bucharest team
    * Brexit
    * General SOE building with release teams.
    * Australia
    * Multi Currency MIDs
    * Mastercard Japan
    * End To End Orchestration
    *
    * Teams wise I have helped build a remote team in Bucharest for our Customer and Financial Reconciliation Reporting function in Worldpay. We acquired a fintech operation out in Bucharest to help reduce our contractor cost as we stabalised into a strategic tech platform rather than a project.
    * This basically entailed building the knowledge of 7-8 new developers and designers in the team, leading the design process, and taking on the lead role as the product owner was spread quite thin between other projects.
    * Most projects I've worked as part of over the past 2 years have been shorter term integration pieces trying to piece together the last steps of our acquiring platform for migrating of the mainframe. These have entailed building SOEs for technical delivery (such as the brexit project, a migration in itself), building delivery plans for coupled components which are delivered across streams (and driving de-coupling opportunities as part of these projects).
    * Leadership skills are those I would like to grow, as I've had exposure within the reporting outfit, and within these projects, and leading the automation team within our platform (whilst that team effectively sits in infrastructure as a wider piece).
    * Personally the most important work I think I've done in leadership is protecting my peers & helping solve tension between teams when things have not gone as planned. There are a whole host of reasons why things go certain ways and certain decisions are made, which need to be understood rather than blamed to help prevent these in future (what would have stopped me making the same decision? Hindsight?)

  * What is your current role like on a week to week basis?
    * Almost a platform consultant in nature of working with the engineering teams to help review and guide their technology decisions against the wider platform where appropriate - something which is changing as roles become more decoupled & better idempotence is created, but that isn't there yet so I have been help guide impacts of software delivery, and help engineers understand the wider platform.
    This often includes helping engineers understand the business impacts of the decisions they are making, such as
    * I would see myself as how people generally refer to staff engineer - architect roles, where I am playing the role of "glue" for 50-60% of the week and delivering change projects in the remainder of the time (Australia & Multi-Currency MIDs, Brexit).

    * The historic nature of our platform being a distributed monolith makes a lot of what sound benign projects more difficult than necessary to deliver as we have to manage multiple delivery trains across our platform and
    * I also manage the end to end automation of the services throughout our platform, which generally means for each release reaching out to multiple teams to understand how they want to implement their service and building that into the automation software. As a side project we're currently building out the automation framework so it can sit inside the individual development teams - it's something which has taken a long time to come to fruition as we were tied into a particular software where the next version provided a solid framework to move this process left, however the automation team ownership sat outside our teams ownership, so that was again a case of convincing multiple people that the upgrade would drive value through reducing test cycles and delivery time / cognitive load on E2E teams.
    * I ran the brown bag sessions for our team, which I found useful in building knowledge outside of tech as much as within ()

  * How would you adapt/transfer your key skills and experience to this role?
    * I would like to adapt my practices to this role to have a more effective approach to project management & delivering with teams - the nature of this job implies there will be multiple Ëœ
    * Taking charge of a team will be another aspect I haven't had direct management of in a while.
  * What challenges would you expect to face coming into this role?
    * Learning the detail behind the product - what VISA Direct is, and how it differs from the VisaNet landscape and provides the scale of change promised
    * Picking up skills in management and planning which I've previously been involved in a contributory manner.
    * Managing and maintaining project plans when acquirers are working on different SDLCs to ours - some will be newer and much more agile, and being able to align their rate of change against ours, versus working with more established acquirers for which we might be integrated with a more six sigma approach as their service is

  * What would I like to receive from VISA, or get out of the experience?
    * Exposure to client based operations which are working on the cutting edge of payments, and delivering real change to customers where you will be able to see their progress and the changing face of their originator systems as they adapt to real time payments systems.
    * Having a voice in how payments is adapted, working with talented people who will be bringing ideas which challenge the way we think about payments and cause me to question the boundaries I have.
    * Opportunity to be exposed to


# Influencing Skills

* In the role of E2E orchestration owner, generally I have had to help guide the prioritisation process of where it appears work is needed on the platform which is not seen by individual silos or prioritisation groups outside not involved with the end to end. The place I usually helped influence was by demonstrating a weakness in our integration points, and how improvement there would help deliver significant value which was not always obvious. One case was our delay in payment suspensions based on a manual process, which created a cascading effect of delays to merchant settlement and customer reporting (which used settlement generation data). By showing the improved customer experience possible (we brought in report delivery by 8 hours and all but removed missed payment SLAs), we got the required sponsors for automation of the payment suspension process.

Similarly, I've regularly worked with business clients to help define the process they want, and drive confidence through prototypes or simple definitions of complex issues to help understanding of the goal the project is aiming to achieve. An example recently was the Australia next day settlement project, where we were not able to hit a next day merchant settlement target as the scheme settlement timelines did not line up to avoid pre-funding.
