# Key Info

_Push Payments_: Buyer Initiated payments, where buyer provides the card details and then pays the sellers bank account.
  * Push payments are considered non-repudiable (safe to spend immediately) as the buy has authorised the transaction.
  * Reduce payments processing to single transaction management, removing intermediary steps of reconciliation between the two endpoints, and reducing issuer costs associated with payments.
  * Instant payments offer choice to the consumers - gaming is a good industry use case as it returns winnings to keep users at the table.

_Pull Payments_: Supplier Initiated

# VISA Direct

Visa Direct is a real-time push payment platform to enable expedited payments to customers or small businesses using the debit card rails provided via VisaNet. It has processed 3.4 billion transactions as of late March (2bn in the last year). Visa Direct is currently open as three options:

1. Business to Customer (B2C)
2. Business to Small Business (B2SB)
3. Peer to Peer / Person to Person (P2P)

One oft cited use case is payments to the gig-economy, where businesses like Uber will be managing the debiting of fares from customers centrally, however Uber drivers can opt to be paid for their fare immediately via push payment (at a fee from Uber) rather than a daily settled ACH payment which could take days to actually reach bank accounts where the banking route or issuer has slower settlement timelines (or don't work weekends / bank holidays).

The reach of Visa Direct is 200 countries and territories. These cross border payments allow money to move real time cross border removing the settlement delays associated with banking systems cross borders. **Remove the requirement of originators / acquirers to have to setup connections to local payment networks**

## Earthport

Visa owns one of the largest independent account clearing house (ACH) networks - so basically now VISA can use push payments through both card and bank rails. This has opened up a large network of accessibility for VISA direct payouts, which furthers the network effect of VISA Direct & therefore increses its growth and value.

# Interview

## Senior Solution Consultant

* Supporting Acquirer and Originator Enablement
  * I imagine this will entail building relationships with new and existing acquirers and help them build their product roadmap to enable Visa Debit integration.
  * This will likely also require building product overviews and understanding how customers want to take push payments forward, including understanding what their acquirer platforms help enable and how the features Visa Direct provides can help move them towards new opportunities.
  * This could be a useful place for value chain mapping to show how the landscape will change for companies as they start to embrace push payments.
  * Will need to help acquirers understand the changing nature of payments and how the model will affect their business - for example if an acquirer only settles a merchant on a daily basis, there is a increased risk associated where effectively the scheme deductions are liable.



# Visa Possible Questions

  * Why you want to work at Visa? Why do you want this role?
    * It's an institution, as Zero said to Mr Gustaf in Grand Budapest Hotel.
    * It's an ubuiquitous entity which everyone instantly associates with payments, and provides the means for people, businesses, and governments to thrive by opening up payment possibilities to them.
    * Empowers businesses by providing them the rails to take payments from customers across the globe, abstracts the complexity of cross border payments, etc.
    * Has a strong inclusion and diversity presence, I found that incredibly powerful to see pages and pages of Women and people from diverse backgrounds in positions of leadership and influence. I think a lot of the issue with getting women into tech is around the stigmas which are ingrained in schools and not having role models who represent their backgrounds.


  * What examples do you have of providing support/leading teams/managing projects?
    * Building Bucharest team
    * Brexit
    * General SOE building with release teams.
    * Australia
    * Multi Currency MIDs
    * Mastercard Japan
    * End To End Orchestration
    *
    * Teams wise I have helped build a remote team in Bucharest for our Customer and Financial Reconciliation Reporting function in Worldpay. We acquired a fintech operation out in Bucharest to help reduce our contractor cost as we stabalised into a strategic tech platform rather than a project.
    * This basically entailed building the knowledge of 7-8 new developers and designers in the team, leading the design process, and taking on the lead role as the product owner was spread quite thin between other projects.
    * Most projects I've worked as part of over the past 2 years have been shorter term integration pieces trying to piece together the last steps of our acquiring platform for migrating of the mainframe. These have entailed building SOEs for technical delivery (such as the brexit project, a migration in itself), building delivery plans for coupled components which are delivered across streams (and driving de-coupling opportunities as part of these projects).
    * Leadership skills are those I would like to grow, as I've had exposure within the reporting outfit, and within these projects, and leading the automation team within our platform (whilst that team effectively sits in infrastructure as a wider piece).
    * Personally the most important work I think I've done in leadership is protecting my peers & helping solve tension between teams when things have not gone as planned. There are a whole host of reasons why things go certain ways and certain decisions are made, which need to be understood rather than blamed to help prevent these in future (what would have stopped me making the same decision? Hindsight?)

  * What is your current role like on a week to week basis?
    * Almost a platform consultant in nature of working with the engineering teams to help review and guide their technology decisions against the wider platform where appropriate - something which is changing as roles become more decoupled & better idempotence is created, but that isn't there yet so I have been help guide impacts of software delivery, and help engineers understand the wider platform.
    This often includes helping engineers understand the business impacts of the decisions they are making, such as
    * I would see myself as how people generally refer to staff engineer - architect roles, where I am playing the role of "glue" for 50-60% of the week and delivering change projects in the remainder of the time (Australia & Multi-Currency MIDs, Brexit).

    * The historic nature of our platform being a distributed monolith makes a lot of what sound benign projects more difficult than necessary to deliver as we have to manage multiple delivery trains across our platform and
    * I also manage the end to end automation of the services throughout our platform, which generally means for each release reaching out to multiple teams to understand how they want to implement their service and building that into the automation software. As a side project we're currently building out the automation framework so it can sit inside the individual development teams - it's something which has taken a long time to come to fruition as we were tied into a particular software where the next version provided a solid framework to move this process left, however the automation team ownership sat outside our teams ownership, so that was again a case of convincing multiple people that the upgrade would drive value through reducing test cycles and delivery time / cognitive load on E2E teams.
    * I ran the brown bag sessions for our team, which I found useful in building knowledge outside of tech as much as within ()

  * How would you adapt/transfer your key skills and experience to this role?
    * I would like to adapt my practices to this role to have a more effective approach to project management & delivering with teams - the nature of this job implies there will be multiple Ëœ
    * Taking charge of a team will be another aspect I haven't had direct management of in a while.
  * What challenges would you expect to face coming into this role?
    * Learning the detail behind the product - what VISA Direct is, and how it differs from the VisaNet landscape and provides the scale of change promised
    * Picking up skills in management and planning which I've previously been involved in a contributory manner.
    * Managing and maintaining project plans when acquirers are working on different SDLCs to ours - some will be newer and much more agile, and being able to align their rate of change against ours, versus working with more established acquirers for which we might be integrated with a more six sigma approach as their service is

  * What would I like to receive from VISA, or get out of the experience?
    * Exposure to client based operations which are working on the cutting edge of payments, and delivering real change to customers where you will be able to see their progress and the changing face of their originator systems as they adapt to real time payments systems.
    * Having a voice in how payments is adapted, working with talented people who will be bringing ideas which challenge the way we think about payments and cause me to question the boundaries I have.
    * Opportunity to be exposed to



# Influencing Skills

* In the role of E2E orchestration owner, generally I have had to help guide the prioritisation process of where it appears work is needed on the platform which is not seen by individual silos or prioritisation groups outside not involved with the end to end. The place I usually helped influence was by demonstrating a weakness in our integration points, and how improvement there would help deliver significant value which was not always obvious. One case was our delay in payment suspensions based on a manual process, which created a cascading effect of delays to merchant settlement and customer reporting (which used settlement generation data). By showing the improved customer experience possible (we brought in report delivery by 8 hours and all but removed missed payment SLAs), we got the required sponsors for automation of the payment suspension process.

Similarly, I've regularly worked with business clients to help define the process they want, and drive confidence through prototypes or simple definitions of complex issues to help understanding of the goal the project is aiming to achieve. An example recently was the Australia next day settlement project, where we were not able to hit a next day merchant settlement target as the scheme settlement timelines did not line up to avoid pre-funding.


# My Questions

* What is the role meant to entail? Would this usually include travel?

* What technical exposure is there in this role?

* What technology is VISA Direct built on / what type of technologies are we expecting Acquirers to be integrating via?

* How does VISA maintain it's scalability infrastructure

* Where does this career track lead within VISA, is this a lead into software architecture or towards programme management?

* What involvement in soft frameworks would you be expecting vs what I could involve myself in?

* What opportunities are there to teach / be taught at VISA?

* What support would I be offered in being able to build the skills necessary for the role, online learning / courses.

* Is this role intending to help acquirers setup their capabilities with Visa Direct, or to start moving towards working as an acquirer now that instant payments removes part of the liability risk management provided by acquirers?

* What are the organisation and team management aspects of the role going to entail? Will I be managing projects directly, or as an overseer of multiple projects where I would be more likely to delegate planning, and play a prioritisation role etc.

* How come this role wasn't an internal hire?

* How does VISA promote mentorship and sponsorship?

* What are the diversity levels within technology?

* What would the team look like?

* How will Earthport extend the Visa Direct offering? Is that by the ability to build it into the open banking rails?

* Where do you see the growth in Visa Direct over the next 2-3 years?

* Architectural Katas / Self learning vs Course Based / Time allocated for learning?

*

## Questions I Was Asked:

* How have I dealt with painful people to work with?
  * Usually people need time and space to be heard
  * PIR example of understanding how people have come to that decision - blameless societys, how do you change the model.
  * These seemed okay, improve upon actions that came out of it.

* How have you got to where you are?
  * Story of worldpay - think this was good but could make it more concise. Went through background of how I joined worldpay, worked in test of reports, moved into the design team and leading a team out in Bucharest, which was a new fintech team and needed help understanding the platform. Things I learnt from this were that it wasn't best to spoon feed, it would have been better to set exercises and for them to understand the data models that way.
  * I would also put a lot more on them to come up with the ideas etc, as my initial way of working was to drive the change but had little buy in from the team as they were less involved. This might have worked with more hierarchical teams but the culture was likely a bit more egalitarian and they wanted to be involved in design.

* Why do you want to leave worldpay
  * Said that I was quite comfortable at Worldpay - could have said I am in a good position at worldpay _because_ we've got to a position where we're about to drive a lot of change in the platform, around technology and the acquiring background, such as building our regionalisation model. However this was a particularly interesting role to be a part of and will put me a little out of my comfort zone, so is a place where I can learn and grow in my role, and be a part of change in the industry in general. This will start to drive huge growth for both VISA and other acquirers based on the model possible, particulary where an acquirer can start trading in a region it doesn't yet have banking ties with but can be paid out via VISA direct.

* What are your best qualities
  * This was a good section - conveyed my holistic nature and overall understanding of concepts of business against concepts of technology.

* What do your friends think about you?
  * Calm, loyal, need to think of a better way to say I can question things without sounding argumentative.
  * It might be good to contextualise this by mentioning how there are a lot of difficult topics and I like to talk about them with people.

## Things of note

* Mentioned the importance of data and visualising that to the customer
* Tableau and Power BI as tools to research over coming weeks
*

# Possible Questions Interview 2

* Stakeholder Management
  * Despite not managing external clients, have dealt with internal product teams and feeding back to our VP level / CTO level to explain the context of the issues, why this needs resolution, and plan to change.
* Communication
  * Communication was not one of my stronger points when I was a kid so this is something I have worked on throughout my career, I've taken positions of leading teams, I've led technical courses for grad joiners in PL/SQL, my role at the moment requires me to convey the mechanisms of the platform and of acquiring regularly for large groups across our global teams as part of releases, or when building impact assessments etc.
  * One thing I've found since working with offshore teams is how articulate things more slowly and clearly given that listening to a fast talking Yorkshire accent isn't always easy when it's someones second language! Particularly with online meetings now ubiquitous it's important to ensure people are understanding, I personally try to be on camera as much as possible as it not only shows you body language when talking but also when listening, and helps people place better how much you might be taking in.
* Motivations/Enthusiasm
  * I'm motivated by solving complex problems which have an interesting business context, really enjoy working with teams to put together those designs and seeing those projects come into being and taking life.
  * Seeing what is delivered showing value is a great feeling here.
  * Think it's important to remember as projects become agile that you should be congratulating regularly within the iterations as it's more difficult to determine the end point given that the point of agile is to be able to maintain a continuous state of delivery, but at that point it becomes less obvious when you have achieved something.
  * I would be really excited to work with other highly motivated groups who are great at sharing knowledge and ideas, and having the prerogative to help bring those ideas to life.
  * I personally would like to stay close to technical knowledge and to keep up to date with that aspect, even if this role is likely to be more on the product management role - ideally I would use this role to really get to know the VISA Direct product and the way the company works, and use that as a sounding board to moving towards more technical architecture roles.
  *  
* Overall working style
  * Someone who will take the time to understand the problem, generally like to be inquisitive about why decisions are being made and understanding the basis for decisions.
  * Work best as part of a team who can throw ideas around or plan together, and share information between the teams.
* Knowledge of Visa and Payments industry
  * What do I think VISA Direct will bring and how that will work
    * How VISA direct will drive huge growth into VISA as basically every transaction will be new value as they would have previously been ACH based transactions. That means the turnover and fees gained will grow on a strongly linear growth pattern?
  * Dynamics of cryptocurrencies and how they will change payments. Though, when does Bitcoin become legitimate? USD Coin is good because it is being pegged to USD so is not of value to horde.
  * Scheme machinations - fraud monitoring / FX
  *
* Data based presentations
  * Reviewing Tableau and Power BI - both presentations layers built on basically low code platforms - allow you to drop and drag to build datasets and then visualise on top of that.
  * Not familiar with their GUIs directly, however very experienced at working with data and data models at the database level and building queries which use analytical functions etc to provide information, building to cover data defects, designing functions & queries which would be used to drive decisions within programs, as well as building dashboards for business users in Oracle Apex.
