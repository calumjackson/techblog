After half-looking for tech events for a while, _eventually_ I became aware of [meetup](https://www.meetup.com) and the many, _many_ options available. The choice is almost overwhelming, the hardest part being choosing which event to go to when there are clashes, and perhaps making sure you understand the aim of the talk...

Some of the talks advertised will be direct pitches!
What seems to separate your experience will be the ability to see what other communities are building, how they are building them, what they are building them with, and so forth.

In my limited experience of these events, I've been given encouragement in the software I've started using (seeing a lead engineer's codebase in [Atom](https://atom.com), a hackable text editor I'd only started using very recently), been made aware of interesting technologies I could see easily applied to work / personal projects, and met people whose palpable excitement to be working on new technology can be contagious.

In any case, hopefully the free beer and pizza at these events will hopefully not throw me off too much in remembering enough to spiel on the pages here.
