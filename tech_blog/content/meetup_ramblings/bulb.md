Today was a wet day. The first real rain we've seen this side of summer and all of London fell to pieces. Liverpool St station was flooding, Tfl was breaking down, and the imposing entrance of the Broadgate Business Centre was miserably out of action as I arrived at this meetup. Luckily the talks were less miserable, _iiiiffff_ slightly vague, deep, and near comical.

#### Scott Logic on Devops

Quite a good overview on how devops is not a tooling piece but a set of cultures which incoporate aspects such as good tooling, CI/CD, agile/lean, etc to create a steamlined deployment process with high levels of monitoring, automation, and **focus on reducing pain of operations**.

Was quite a high level review of practices, if I hadn't read the Jez Humbles book page by page recently I would have found it more interesting - one thing he did mention which was of note was that a recent update to the Devops Handbook mentions how economic value is being attributed to how well defined a devops delivery culture is being maintained at a company. Possibly because this is a signifier of reaction to change.

Was too scared to ask about best practices for Andon Cords. Still not sure how these translate to enterprise level software companies - how many or how few is the right number to _swarm_ a problem? Does this get limited to the scrum team working on the problem? The service team?

#### Bulb on Terraform

Tom Bulb (as he was later referred to by speaker three) went quite low level on Terraform usage, showing how the YAML was build to define the deployments. Bulb had quite an interesting stack which I've now forgotten and will have to watch the video to remember fully. Sounded like they were migrating off a monolith of off-the-shelf products to a microservice architecture built across GCP.



#### Migrating to Kubernetes

This guy didn't really talk about migrating to Kubernetes. He talked about setting up Kubernetes, based on him having a K8 setup in his loft. Was a bit of a farcical talk despite him seeming to have quite a low level knowledge of the stack.

Mentioned _Absolute Kubernetes_ as a useful source of git knowledge for setting up K8 patterns?
