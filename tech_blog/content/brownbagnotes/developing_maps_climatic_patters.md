#### Climatic Patterns

Wardley notes that climatic patterns are those things / ideas which change on the map **regardless of your actions**, such as the evolution of hardware and software to commodity, evolution into **new** areas based on the commoditisation allowing for this (Utilities allowing Genesis), and that efficiency enables innovation.

This all seems quite straightforward but is useful to see how you can map to move around those aspects, or at least define the landscape so you can share a discussion with the people around you.

#### One does not fit all

An interesting note is how one map will not be able to fit all aspects we are trying to discuss - no map will ever be perfect. The analogy being, what is the perfect map of France? 1:1? What use is a map the size of France?

A good usage of maps to show this in software development is how development methodologies apply to different areas of the evolution cycle, as shown below.
