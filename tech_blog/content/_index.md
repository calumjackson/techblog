# About me

---

Hello!

I'm Calum, a solutions architect with all my basic knowledge coming for a CS degree at Edinburgh University, and the rest from getting help from many, many people in various enterprise environments throughout my 8 years in engineering.

I've had a strong background in forgetting most of what I've learnt as quickly as possible, so I've setup these pages mainly to fuel my own learnings given I retain the knowledge for slightly longer if I write it down. If you find any of this interesting or want to offer a contrasting opinion, feel free to get in touch :smile:!

This site is really only going to be a playground for me to mess around with css, markdown, and my thoughts in general, so aesthetics & functionality will be hit and miss. Enjoy! :wink:
