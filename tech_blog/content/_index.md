# About me

---

I've setup these pages mainly to fuel my own learnings as I forget things almost instantly if I don't write them down. If you find any of this interesting or want to tell me I'm wrong, feel free to get in touch :smile:!

This is also going to basically be a playground for me to mess around with Markdown, so I apologise in advance if elements in this site don't work or look plain bad. I say I apologise, but the only sleep I'll be losing over it will be the late nights I spent writing the bad code in the first place :wink:
