Trisha was talking about how to improve your career by being aware of buzzwords and key phrases. This wasn't so much to deceive people by pretending that you knew what you were talking about, but to be aware of what the current trends are so that you can _pay attention_ when you notice interesting articles with those buzzwords.

The majority of the talk was around picking out interesting articles, saving them to a _close to hand_ reading app, like **Pocket**, or **Medium**, which allow you save the articles for later reading.
