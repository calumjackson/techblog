Trisha was talking about how to improve your career by being aware of buzzwords and key phrases. This wasn't so much to deceive people by pretending that you knew what you were talking about, but to be aware of what the current trends are so that you can _pay attention_ when you notice interesting articles with those buzzwords.

The majority of the talk was around picking out interesting articles, saving them to a _close to hand_ reading app, like **Pocket**, or **Medium**, which allow you save the articles for later reading.

### Four Steps of keeping in the loop

#### Awareness

Use websites / blogs / infoq updates to browse the key words and see what is relevant.

#### Speaking the Lingo

Start using the key words in conversations, see what happens.

#### Enough Knowledge to be Dangerous

Read some of the articles about the thing you find interesting, to be able to understand it slightly more thoroughly.

#### Code

Practice writing some simple code for that language. Then you will have an idea of how it used and some of the novel aspects of it.


#### Other Points

* Put your skills & buzzwords at the end of your CV (to satisfy the bots) - keep the human side at the beginning, tell the reader what you do and what you are looking for.

* Try to do stuff that interests you outside of work, and push to make work put time / money into investing your skills for work. If you learn things in your own time to keep you in the loop for your current job, your next job will be the same. If you learn new things in your spare time, your next job can be to do with those things.

* Try to keep ahead of the curve by looking at what will be current in the future and what is actually current now, as if you invest a lot of time in something which isn't, it is a bit of a waste. (I imagine this falls down a bit if you take a gamble on a technology which doesn't kick off, but that is probably a bit like entrepreneurship, sometimes it will work, sometimes it won't, just keep in the know to realise when you've backed the wrong horse).

* Go to user groups and meet people, ask them what they are doing, if their company does interesting things, if they have jobs etc. People are one of the best routes into other work.
