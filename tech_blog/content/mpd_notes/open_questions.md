### Questions to direct to business teams


#### Merchant Business Window alignment:

* Is a merchants business day limited by the scheme clearing BINs they are aligned to?

* Could a merchant be transacting under a set of BINs which run on different cycles, and therefore transactions in different CIBs would implicitly become part of the

* What are we gaining from the merchant liability gap?

* How do we want to hold the bulkers to account for their submission times?

* Is there any case where we don't want to hold bulkers to their submission times?

* How would APS / MLU organise any holding of the schedule to allow late bulk submissions anyway.

* Is there a concept of a merchant processing date when lined up against non-daily schemes?

  * Should we be running scheme cycle updates every day, but clearing only every three days?

  * Is it a problem that transactions are stuck in APM Forward until Monday morning for non-daily schemes.

  * MPD will **have** to be set to the day of clearing currently as otherwise it will be missed from daily reporting. FX rates will be correct so not a huge deal there.

  * Might be confusing for customer currently as transactions submitted over the weekend will appear a few days later for certain schemes.
