      <description>My. First. Meetup.
I turned up to this as a lone ranger, without knowing what to really expect other than the possibility of free beer and pizza! The CodeNode I was aware of from a previous Worldpay &amp;ldquo;mini tech conference&amp;rdquo; back in 2017, and has a cool setup. Note: maybe we should encourage someone to do another tech conference.
This meetup had been organised by Infrastructure as Code, under the Skills matter umbrella.</description>
